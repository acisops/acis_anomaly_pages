DEA Sequencer Reset During a Science Observation
================================================

What is it?
-----------

The DEA sequencer crashes, resulting in loss of science data from all
video boards for the rest of the science run.

When did it happen before?
--------------------------

The DEA Sequencer has reset three times during the mission; most recently in 2013.

Will it happen again?
---------------------

It appears likely that the anomaly will occur again.

What is the first response?
---------------------------

Most likely we will be notified by CXCDS Ops that data ceased prematurely
for an observation. We need to process the dump data and get access to the
CXC products, send an e-mail to the ACIS team (including Peter Ford, Bob Goeke, 
Mark Bautz, and Bev LaMarr), and convene a telecon at the next reasonable moment. 
We should examine data from the next observation because the setup for the next
observation should clear the problem.

Impacts
-------

* The last portion of the science run will be lost. The following science run should be unaffected.
